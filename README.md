# Gearbox Grid

A React + TypeScript puzzle game where you stabilize a workshop control panel.

## How It Works

- Click a switch to toggle it and its neighbors.
- Turn off every light to stabilize the panel.
- Choose a difficulty to change grid size and scramble strength.
- Best moves are tracked per difficulty.
- Use Show Solution to highlight a valid clear pattern.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
